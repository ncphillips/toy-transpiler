# Toy Transpiler

I made this transpiler while watching the
Destroy All Software screencast [A Compiler From Scratch](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch).

Instead of following along in Ruby, I decided
to follow along in Rust. Due to the nature of 
rust, This has lead to a few significantly 
different design decisions, but overall it 
works the same way.

## Todo

- Make `token_kinds` STATIC?
- Better way to do sub-types of Token?
